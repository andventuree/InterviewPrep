/* Reading: ch4 - Trees and graphs

When given a tree problem, you must clarify the facts. Incorrectly assuming something will derail the problem.
Look out for these issues:

Binary Tree vs Binary Search Tree
BT simply implies the left children are all lower than or equal to current node. Not that there's just 2 children.

Balanced vs Unbalanced
If your tree is not balanced, describe your algorithm in terms of worst case and average case.

Full and Complete
Implies that all nodes have 2 children with the exception of leaves.
Highly unlikely to meet this condition.

Binary Tree Traversal
Get good at implementing a) in-order, b) post-order c)pre-order

Tree Balancing
Very rare! You should be familiar with the runtime operations on balanced trees,
and vaguely familiar with how you might balance a tree.

Tries
Each path down the tree just makes a word.
