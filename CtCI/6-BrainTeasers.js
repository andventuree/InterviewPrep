/* Reading: ch 6 - Brain teasers
Technically banned but ppl still ask them b/c definition is vague. Tips:

1. Talk as much as possible
2. Establish rules and patterns.
   Personal tip: may be helpful to point out the obvious approach then see how
   it can be pushed out of the box.

Brain teasers focus on logic, math and/or CS . Realize that specific numbers are given b/c there's necessary precision.

Worst case balancing - The obvious thought will generally lead you to your constraints too quickly. Rather, devise a way to fall within limits by getting closer with each attempt or calculation.

Given 9 balls, 8 are equal weight, find the heaviest ball in 2 weighings on balance scale. Separate the balls into piles of 3. Put two piles onto scale so the results will tell you which pile is heavier. Then weight 2 balls out of that pile leaving you with heaviest ball some where.

3 & 5 quart => you want 4 quarts
fill 5, pour into 3, then fill 5 again and pour into 3 again, leaving you with 4 quarts. This works b/c of prime numbers.

100 floors and 2 eggs. Find n floor. egg breaks > n , egg doesn't break <= n
Start on 14 then increment up by n - 1;
^14, ^13, ^12 ... this limits number of tries to 14 and you're bound to see n.

Given 8x8 (=64) chess board with 2 diagonal corners cut off. Gotta lay out 31 dominos (covers 2 spaces) onto board, is it possible?
Might seem possible but it isnt. Board has black and white colors. If 2 diagonal corners are cut out, they are they same color. Given that dominos will always touch 1 white and 1 black square, there are not enough of either black/white square to use.

20 pill jars. 19 jars have pills at 1 gram. 1 bottle has pills at 1.1 gram. How to find which jar is heavier when you can only weigh it once?
1st jar, take 1 pill => 1 gram
2nd jar, take 2 pills => 2 grams
nth jar, take n pills => n grams
The heavier jar will stand out from the total with math.
211.3 suggests the 1.1 gram jar is the 13th jar.
