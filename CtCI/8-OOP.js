/* Reading: ch 8 - Object oriented design

Intention is to see how you write code. Red flags here suggest red flags on the job.

Steps
1. clarify every thing
2. Define the core objects
3. Analyze relationships - Which objs can you inherit from? How general pupose things should be.
4. Investigate actions

Unlikely to be tested on design patterns but doesn't hurt to know them.
Singleton class - Ensures that a class has only one instance and ensures access to the instance through the application. E.g., Only 1 instance in the global scope.

Factory method - Offers an interface for creating an instance of a class. Basically a function that will make whatever pre-created class you're asking for in the arguments.
