/* Reading: ch 2 - Linked list

Linked list questions don't vary too much from well known questions.

Runner technique - To save time iterating through, have more than 1 pointer
e.g., Pointer 1 = faster pointer that jumps nodes by 2
Pointer 2 = slower pointer that jumps nodes by 1
By the time Pointer 1 is done iterating through, Pointer 2 is likely at the midpoint

Generally, its easier to deal with LL through recursion. So give that approach an attempt first.
